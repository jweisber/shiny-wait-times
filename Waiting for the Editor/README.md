# Waiting for the Editor

An app for visualizing wait time data collected by [the APA Journal Survey](https://blog.apaonline.org/2017/04/13/journal-surveys-assessing-the-peer-review-process/").

Two kinds of visualization are available: scatterplots and ridgeplots. The ridgeplots show probable wait times more explicitly. But the scatterplots expose changes over time. **Note that some journals have gotten significantly better/worse in recent years.** Read [this post](http://jonathanweisberg.org/post/Journal%20Surveys/) for more.

Further caveats:

- This is volunteer data, so it's biased by self-selection. One such bias is that [accepted submissions are overrepresented](http://jonathanweisberg.org/post/Journal%20Surveys/#acceptance-rates). (You can filter out accepted submissions to help with this issue.)
- The cap on review times squashes the data, rather than filtering it. When the cap is set to 18 months for example, all longer review times are modified to 18 months.
- Some data is filtered out because it appears to be erroneous. See the discussion under "Timeline" [here](http://jonathanweisberg.org/post/Journal%20Surveys/#timeline).
