<p>
This app displays data about wait times collected by <a href="https://blog.apaonline.org/2017/04/13/journal-surveys-assessing-the-peer-review-process/" target="_blank">the APA Journal Survey</a>.

<ol>
  <li>The scatterplots expose any changes over time in a journal's turnaround times.</li>
  <li>Ridgeplots show estimates of probable wait times.</li>
</ol>

The ridgeplots show more directly what we're intersted in, but they can also be misleading, if a journal has recently improved its turnaround times for example. <strong>Some journals have gotten significantly better/worse in recent years.</strong> Read <a href="http://jonathanweisberg.org/post/Journal%20Surveys/" target="_blank">this post</a> for more.

<p>
Other important caveats:

<ul>
  <li>This is volunteer data, hence biased by self-selection. One such bias is that <a href="http://jonathanweisberg.org/post/Journal%20Surveys/#acceptance-rates" target="_blank">accepted submissions are overrepresented</a>. You can filter out accepted submissions to help with this issue.</li>
  <li>The cap on review times squashes the data, rather than filter it. When the cap is set to 18 months, all longer review times are modified to 18 months.</li>
  <li>Some data is filtered out because it appears to be erroneous. See the discussion under "Timeline" <a href="http://jonathanweisberg.org/post/Journal%20Surveys/#timeline" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
